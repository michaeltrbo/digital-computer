This repository showcases my implementations of the projects from the "NAND2Tetris" course, by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken, where we construct a complete 16-bit computer system from scratchâ€”beginning with fundamental NAND gates and progressing to high-level applications.

**Project 1 - Logic Gates**
- Built essential logic gates using NAND as the only primitive.
- Includes NOT, AND, OR, XOR, Multiplexer, and Demultiplexer.

**Project 2 - Arithmetic**
- Constructed essential arithmetic circuits using foundational logic gates.
- Components include Half Adder, Full Adder, 16-bit Adder, Incrementer, and the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU).

**Project 3 - Memory**
- In Progress
